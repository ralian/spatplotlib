# spatplotlib
Spatial plotting with Leaflet and Matplotlib. Forked from parts of both mplleaflet and mplexporter.

Most of my work on this has been modernization, as well as dropping the dependency on jinja2 in favor of native python formatting.

## What's new with spatplotlib?

This is a work in progress right now, but here are some goals I have for spatplotlib:
1. Interactive data viewer for metadata attached to spatial data
2. More color and formatting options
3. Quiver plots, contour maps, and other sorts of plots
4. Animations?
